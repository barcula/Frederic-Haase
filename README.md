# Conceptual formulation

The next steps was it to create a digital version of our analogue algorithm. 
We were not forced to do it exactly the same but it should have something to do with our first projekt.
My aim was it work close to my first exercise to see if i can manage it to tell the programm "processing" 
exactly what i want to have and not to work with any random results.

# Development of the projekt

For me it was neccesairy to keep the optical look of paint dabs. 
So i deceided to use png-Images of them and make them appear randomly on the white sheet
