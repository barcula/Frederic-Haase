# Conceptual formulation

The next steps was it to create a digital version of our analogue algorithm. 
We were not forced to do it exactly the same but it should have something to do with our first projekt.
My aim was it work close to my first exercise to see if i can manage it to tell the programm "processing" 
exactly what i want to have and not to work with any random results.

# Development of the projekt

For me it was neccesairy to keep the optical look of paint dabs. 
So i deceided to use png-Images of them and make them appear randomly on the white sheet. It was quite a long time for the next step: Put ellipses around every dab in different sizes and forms. But finally it worked.
The last thing i need to do was to mark the intersection points of two or more ellipses with a black dot. At this point i didn`t come forward so i decided to break this idea a little bit down. So i said make exactly one dot at every ellipse and connect these points with black lines.

#Installation

You need to download processing to put this code into execution
https://processing.org/download/


# Usage
You copy the folder ++data++ and Finaldigital to your desktop and open the file with processing.
I wrote the code in Python so it`s necessairy to choose python in the upper righthand corner and click the run button
